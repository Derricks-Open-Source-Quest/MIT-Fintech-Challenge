# MIT-Fintech-Challenge

## Datasets:
We provide three datasets:
1. **data_small** has trade/order activities for 1 security. It has a file size of about 30MB, and it has around 180K rows. It would be a great starting point to analyze spoofying activity. 
2. **data_big** has trade/order activities for 3 securities. It has a file size of about 100MB, and it has around 550K rows. This data set would be suitable for someone who has more computational power and want to have a deeper understanding of the data
3. **data** has trade/order activities for 119 securities. It has a file size of about 1.5G, and it has around 8.5M rows. This is a very challening task for someone who want to deploy advanced computation or modeling tools. Good luck!

**data_small.zip** and **data_big.zip** can be found in the current repository, while **data.zip** can be downloaded from the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h0BIGvj91L1hLErspeYkMRbnC2KzMxqK

## Code:
**wrapper.ipynb** can be found in the current repository. Functions to load datasets, to generate cohen's kappa score and to write results to csv files are provided. Students can code up the preprocessing step and classification model in the cell below **Insert Your Code Here**. Simple examples to preprocess data and to fit a logistic regression model is provided. More details are included in the wrapper.ipynb file. 

## Submission:
Please submit your results to the **Submission folder** as a zip file with the following naming convension:
* **Team_teamname.zip** 

The zip file should include four files:
* **Team_teamname.ppt**
* **Team_teamname_wrapper.ipynb**
* Training prediction probabilities:
  * **y_train_prob_pred_small.csv** or **y_train_prob_pred_big.csv** or **y_train_prob_pred.csv**
* Testing prediction probabilities:
  * **y_test_prob_pred_small.csv** or **y_test_prob_pred_big.csv** or **y_test_prob_pred.csv**

There is an example submission in the folder called **Team_test.zip** which includes all the files expect for the slides for your reference.

In case there are unforeseen difficulties submitting the zip files, as an alternative. You can email the zip files to peter@decrem.com or angelajin95@gmail.com

## Grading:
We will use Cohen's Kappa to evaluate the prediction results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa Extra points will also granted to teams which are working with more challenging datasets. Enjoy hacking!

Field			Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
timestamp		Epoch timestamp (milliseconds)
type			ORDER or TRADE
obId			Order book identifier
member			Parent company (trader)
user			Office/Branch (trader)
endUserRef		Desk/Person (trader)
price			Price
volume			Quantity / Number of contracts
operation		INSERT, UPDATE or CANCEL (orders only)
isBid			true if bid order, false if ask order (orders only)
orderId			Order ID for tracking across life-cycle (orders only)
source			USER if activity was initiated by the trader, SYSTEM if it's e.g. a (partial) fill (orders only)
tradeId			Trade ID (trades only)
bidOrderId		Bid order associated with trade (trades only)
askOrderId		Ask order associated with trade (trades only)
isBuyer			true if trader is buyer, false if trader is seller (trades only)
isAggressor		true if trader is aggressor (taker), false otherwise (maker)
bestBid			Best bid price
bestBidVolume	Volume available at best bid
bestAsk			Best ask price
bestAskVolume	Volume available at best ask
lv2Bid			Level 2 bid price
lv2BidVolume	Volume available at level 2 bid
lv2Ask			Level 2 ask price
lv2AskVolume	Volume available at level 2 ask
lv3Bid			Level 3 bid price
lv3BidVolume	Volume available at level 3 bid
lv3Ask			Level 3 ask price
lv3AskVolume	Volume available at level 3 ask
class			0': negative, '1': positive (standard spoofing), '2': positive (spoofing variation), '3': positive (spoofing variation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use 'operation' + 'sourceOfEvent' to infer information about order matching:

		            |	sourceOfEvent = USER	|	sourceOfEvent = SYSTEM
--------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------
operation = INSERT	|	 user inserts order		|	 (n/a)
operation = UPDATE	|	 user updates order		|	 partial fill; remaining qty displayed as "volume"
operation = CANCEL  |    user deletes order     |    fill (order is removed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use 'isAggressor' + 'isBuyer' to infer the direction of the trade as a whole:

					|	isBuyer = TRUE	|	isBuyer = FALSE
--------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------
isAggressor = TRUE	|	 BUY trade		|	 SELL trade
isAggressor = FALSE	|	 SELL trade		|	 BUY trade
