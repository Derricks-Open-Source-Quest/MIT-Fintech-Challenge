# MIT-Fintech-Challenge

## Dataset:
There are three data sets available:
1. **data_small** has trade/order activities for 1 security. It has a file size of about 30MB, and it has around 180K rows. It would be a great starting point to analyze spoofying activity. 
2. **data_big** has trade/order activities for 3 securities. It has a file size of about 100MB, and it has around 550K rows. This data set would be suitable for someone who has more computational power and want to have a deeper understanding of the the data
3. **data** has trade/order activities for 119 securities. It has a file size of about 1.5G, and it has around 8.5M rows. This is a very challening task for someone who want to deploy advanced computation or modeling tools.

data_small.zip and data_big.zip can be found in the current repository, while data.zip can be downloaded from the following google drive link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h0BIGvj91L1hLErspeYkMRbnC2KzMxqK
